 * The SharedAddress component is used to render addresses that can optionally
 * be represented as resolved names, and that are copiable by clicking.
 *
 * The component always expects an `address` prop. If an optional `name` prop
 * is passed, it is shown; otherwise, a truncated version of the address is
 * shown. The component tooltip always has a tooltip with the full address.
 * Additionally, clicking the component will copy the address to the clipboard
 * and present the user with a snackbar message indicating this has occurred.
 *
 * If the optional `nameResolverSystem` property is provided, an info tooltip
 * is included in the component to inform the user of which name resolver
 * system was used to resolve the passed `name`. If no `name` is passed, the
 * `nameResolverSystem` prop is ignored.
